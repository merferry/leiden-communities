\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

We use a server that has two $16$-core x86-based Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors running at $2.90$ GHz. Each core has an L1 cache of $1$ MB, an L2 cache of $16$ MB, and a shared L3 cache of $22$ MB. The machine has $93.4$ GB of system memory and runs on CentOS Stream 8. We use GCC 8.5 and OpenMP 4.5. Table \ref{tab:dataset} shows the graphs we use in our experiments. All of them are obtained from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection \cite{suite19}.

\subsection{Comparing Performance of GVE-Leiden}

We now compare the performance of GVE-Leiden with Vite (Louvain), Grappolo (Louvain), and NetworKit Louvain. For Vite, we convert the graph datasets to Vite's binary graph format, run it on a single node\ignore{(Vite supports distributed community detection)} with threshold cycling/scaling optimization, and measure the reported average total time. For Grappolo, we measure the run it on the same system, and measure the reported total time. For NetworKit, we use a Python script to invoke \texttt{PLM} (Parallel Louvain Method), and measure the total time reported with \texttt{getTiming()}. For each graph, we measure the runtime of each implementation five times, for averaging. We also record the modularity of communities obtained, as reported by each implementation.

Figure \ref{fig:leiden-compare--runtime} shows the runtimes of Vite (Louvain), Grappolo (Louvain), NetworKit Louvain, and GVE-Leiden on each graph in the dataset. Figure \ref{fig:leiden-compare--speedup} shows the speedup of GVE-Leiden with respect to each implementation mentioned above. GVE-Leiden is on average $50\times$, $22\times$, and $20\times$ faster than Vite, Grappolo, and NetworKit respectively. On the \textit{sk-2005} graph, GVE-Leiden finds communities in $6.8$ seconds, and thus achieve a processing rate of $560$ million edges/s. Figure \ref{fig:leiden-compare--modularity} shows the modularity of communities obtained with each implementation. GVE-Leiden on average obtains $3.1\%$ higher modularity than Vite (especially on web graphs), and $0.6\%$ lower modularity than Grappolo and NetworKit (especially on social networks with poor clustering).

\subsection{Analyzing Performance of GVE-Leiden}

The phase-wise and pass-wise split of GVE-Leiden is shown in Figures \ref{fig:leiden-splits--phase} and \ref{fig:leiden-splits--pass} respectively. Figure \ref{fig:leiden-splits--phase} indicates that GVE-Leiden spends most of the runtime in the local-moving phase on \textit{web graphs}, \textit{road networks}, and \textit{protein k-mer graphs}, while it devotes majority of the runtime in the aggregation phase on \textit{social networks}. The pass-wise split (Figure \ref{fig:leiden-splits--pass}) indicates that the first pass dominates runtime on high-degree graphs (\textit{web graphs} and \textit{social networks}), while subsequent passes prevail in execution time on low-degree graphs (\textit{road networks} and \textit{protein k-mer graphs}).

On average, $49\%$ of GVE-Leiden's runtime is spent in the local-moving phase, $35\%$ is spent in the aggregation phase, and $16\%$ is spent in other steps (initialization, renumbering communities, looking up dendrogram, and resetting communities) of the algorithm. Further, $67\%$ of the runtime is spent in the first pass of the algorithm, which is the most expensive pass due to the size of the original graph (later passes work on super-vertex graphs) \cite{com-wickramaarachchi14}.

We also observe that graphs with lower average degree (\textit{road networks} and \textit{protein k-mer graphs}) and graphs with poor community structure (such as \verb|com-LiveJournal| and \verb|com-Orkut|) have a larger $\text{runtime}/|E|$ factor, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:leiden-hardness}.





\subsection{Strong Scaling of GVE-Leiden}

Finally, we measure the strong scaling performance of GVE-Leiden. To this end, we adjust the number of threads from $1$ to $64$ in multiples of $2$ for each input graph, and measure the overall time taken for finding communities with GVE-Leiden, as well as its phase splits (local-moving, aggregation, others), five times for averaging. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:leiden-ss}. With 32 threads, GVE-Leiden obtains an average speedup of $10.4\times$ compared to running with a single thread, i.e., its performance increases by $1.6\times$ for every doubling of threads. Scaling is limited due to the various sequential steps/phases in the algorithm. At 64 threads, GVE-Leiden is impacted by NUMA effects, and offers speedup of only $11.4\times$.
