\subsection{Community labels of super-vertices}

We also attempt two different variations of Parallel Leiden algorithm, one where the community labels of super-vertices (upon aggregation) is based on the local-moving phase (\textit{move-based}), and the other where the community labels of super-vertices is based on the refinement phase (\textit{refine-based}). Our observations indicate that both approaches have roughly the same runtime and modularity on average, as indicated by Figures \ref{fig:leidenreopt-runtime} and \ref{fig:leidenreopt-modularity}. Accordingly, we stick to the move-based approach, which is the one recommended by Traag et al. \cite{com-traag19}. However, the refine-based may be more suitable for the design of dynamic Leiden algorithm (for dynamic graphs).
