  \caption{A flow diagram illustrating the first pass of GVE-Leiden for a Weighted 2D-vector based or a Weighted CSR with degree based input graph. In the local-moving phase, vertex community memberships are updated to obtain community bounds for the refinement phase, until the total change in delta-modularity across all vertices reaches a specified threshold. Then, in the refinement phase, the each vertex is initialized to a singleton community, and the community memberships are updated in is similar manner to the local-moving phase, but vertices change their community membership within their community bound. These community memberships are then counted and renumbered. In the aggregation phase, community vertices in a CSR are first obtained. This is used to create the super-vertex graph stored in a Weighted Holey CSR with degree. In subsequent passes, the input is a Weighted Holey CSR with degree and initial community membership for super-vertices from the previous pass.}
